Due Date: Week 10, Tuesday November 16 @11:59PM

Think about the structure of a building. In order to move between
floors, you need stairs, elevators and ramps. To move between rooms on
a floor, you need hallways and corridors. The methods of circulation
are key functional elements in buildings.
Compare walking into a four story walk up and having to take the
stairs vs having to take an elevator. Now, imagine landing on a web
site and having to click through every page to get to the information
you need on the last page (assuming you know that the information you
need is actually there) vs using a list menu or tab to click directly
to the last page. Your perception of the website and behavior you
exhibit there is affected by the type of circulation available. On the
other hand, maybe you WANT a visitor to your website to be a fl√¢neur
within your PLACE.

Instructions
Create a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you
if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design
element must be well considered.
A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content
should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need
or intention for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is
not enough of a reason. "It is a piece of experimental net-art that
looks cool" might. But probably not.
Some thought starters for what kind of site you could make - a website
for your imaginary design studio, a future exhibition at a museum,
gallery or public space, website for an artist you like, a website
advocating for a social cause you care about.
